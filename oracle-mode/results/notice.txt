Test program for input "fixed strint": 11 branches not taken (no misprediction), 1 branch taken (misprediction) and one ret (Misprediction?)
Why does it say that branches happened at address 00000??
Why are there so many addresses that are "negative" (Very large) and they say "unknown"?
What does it mean when there are blue things?
Why don't the percentages add up when I expand call chain?
Why are dwall and the labels in dwall separate?
Why does it say branch misses for "add" commands?
Does it not know func? Does it thing func has another name?
Why does it see branches in rdtsc?
Maybe it is "intel_check_word"?
